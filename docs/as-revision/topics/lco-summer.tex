This list is not exhaustive and it appears in no particular order.

The written summer exam is (as your final exam will be) \emph{calculator} but will \textbf{not} include Python or C\#. 

In terms of the Computing text book, you should expect questions from Chapters 13--36 inclusive. For the Discrete Maths, expect questions from Chapters 1--4. 

The syllabus will be similar to the AQA AS Level (7516)\cite{syllabus-7516} and elements drawn from the OCR Further Mathematics A (H235/Y534)\cite{syllabus-h245}
